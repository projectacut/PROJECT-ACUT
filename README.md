Overview
The Axion Cyclic Universe Theory (ACUT) proposes that our universe operates through endless cycles of expansion, collapse, and rebirth — regulated by axionic fields, entropy resets, and quantum gravitational dynamics.
This project aims to unify Einstein’s looping universe concept with modern quantum field theory, dark matter physics, and cosmic microwave background (CMB) observations.

Core Hypothesis

1. Axions — ultra-light particles influencing dark matter distribution — act as stabilizing elements during cosmic resets.


2. Singularities within black holes may connect to prior universes via wormhole-like bridges.


3. CMB anomalies and temperature irregularities may contain imprints of earlier cosmic cycles.


4. Entropy does not infinitely increase but resets through phase compression, allowing continuous cosmic rebirth.



Mathematical Framework (Simplified)
The model extends the Friedmann equations to include an axion field term φₐ:

H² = (8πG/3) (ρₘ + ρₐ + ρΛ) − k/a²

where ρₐ = ½(φ̇ₐ)² + V(φₐ) represents the axionic contribution to cosmic energy density.

Entropy dynamics are modeled by a periodic function:
S(t) = S₀ sin²(ωt)
implying entropy resets each cycle period T = π/ω.

Evidence Considered

CMB cold spots — anomalies possibly hinting at pre-Big Bang structures

Axion detection efforts — ADMX, CAST, and haloscope experiments

Supernova data — thermal irregularities that may support cyclic heating

Black hole thermodynamics — potential energy conservation between cycles


Objectives

Model the interaction of axions and gravity at singularity scales

Quantify CMB anomalies under cyclic boundary conditions

Compare predictions with quantum cosmology and observational data

Develop open-source tools for simulation and data analysis
